             The World Wide Web also known as the Internet is made up of over <b><em>30 Billion Documents</em></b>. Although you can put any type of file on the internet the most widely found type is HTML. <b>HTML</b> means <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage.

          <p>
            HTML is made up of:<br><b>Text Content</b> - What you see<br><b>Markup</b> - How it looks<br><b>References to files</b> - i.e. videos, images, and other documents<br><b>Hyperlinks or Links</b> - these connect you to other pages

          <p>
            HTML Tags determine how your page looks and look like this < opening tag>content< /Closing tag>. Different tags do different things such as <b>BOLD</b> or <em>italicize</em>. The whole tag is called an element.

              HTML, CSS, and Java Script are the tools used to build webpages. Each tool has a different Purpose<br><b>HTML:</b> Controls page structure<br><b>CSS:</b> Controls the Style of your page (how it looks)<br><b>Java Script:</b> controls the interactive components of the page

            <span class="section">How HTML Works</span>
</div>   
          <p>
              HTML is the language of the web and just like any other language it has a specific syntax and rules. HTML uses tags to tell the browser how to display the page. An opening tag content and closing tag form an <b>element</b> and looks something like this < ? >content< /?>.

          <p>
                the browser uses DOM <b>D</b>ocument <b>O</b>bject <b>M</b>odel to create a Tree like Structure from the HTML tags and elements. Here is a basic diagram. <br>

    <span class="section">How CSS Works</span>      
  </div>   
          <p>
                CSS is also a language and has its own specific syntax and rules. CSS is used to change how elements look on the page. By adding styles with CSS you can change font, color and any number of other attributes.

  </div>
          <p>
                Every Element in a webpage is a box. Having elements within elements creates boxes within boxes These boxes make it easier to arrange or re-arrange your page. Div elements and P elements are types of Block elements that create the boxes.<br>You can use Class Attributes to label your boxes which will make it easier to identify them when you are ready to begin adding styles.

          <p>
              Don't repeat yourself. If you use the same code over and over you are more likely to make mistakes and those mistakes will be harder to find. MIX IT UP!!!!!

        <span class="section">What is CSS?</span>
  </div>      
          <p>
            CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.

        <span class="section">How does CSS "control" HTML?</span>
  </div>
          <p>
              CSS controls HTML through the use of selectors. Selectors determine if styling is added to the entire element, Specific Tags or class Arttributes

  <div>
        <span class="section">How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?</span>
            </div>
          <p>
              There are 3 ways to get CSS styling in your document: <br>Method 1: write CSS in the head of your HTML. This is best for small projects <br>Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file. This adds a step but allows better organization (requires HTML and CSS files to be in the same folder for this to work)<br> Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML. Not suggested this is a very cumbersome process and requires a lot of repetitive code (something we avoid)
